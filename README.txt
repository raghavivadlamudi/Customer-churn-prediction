# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts customer churn using the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**.  
The goal is to identify customers likely to leave and help businesses improve retention strategies.


## ðŸš€ Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features
   - Normalize numerical features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized churn vs non-churn customers
   - Found correlations  

3. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression âœ… Best recall (0.80)
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost  

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix
   - ROC curve
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `churn_prediction.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook with code & results
- `requirements.txt` â†’ Python libraries needed
- `README.md` â†’ Project documentation  

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Logistic Regression** performed best with Recall = **0.80**  
- Random Forest and XGBoost had good accuracy but lower recall.
